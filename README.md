**TERRA** is a self-supervised foundation model for spatial transcriptomics. It
serializes each cell together with its spatial neighbors into a sequence of gene
tokens, then trains with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA): some
tokens are masked and the model predicts their representations in *latent space* —
rather than reconstructing raw expression — to infer the molecular and spatial
context of the neighboring cells. This yields hierarchical embeddings at the gene,
cell, and neighborhood scales, capturing both a cell's own expression and its
tissue microenvironment.

Pretrained on **HST-Corpus-112M** (>100M cells at single-cell resolution spanning
human spatial-transcriptomics datasets), TERRA produces cell- and neighborhood-level embeddings that transfer to
downstream tasks such as niche and cell-type identification, batch-integrated
atlasing, spatial gene-pair scoring, and in-silico perturbation — without
task-specific retraining.

- 🤗 **Pretrained models:** <https://huggingface.co/Lotfollahi-lab> (`TERRA-96M`, `TERRA-112M`)
- 📓 **Tutorial:** [end-to-end walkthrough](https://terra-st.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html)

## Key features

- **Spatially-aware embeddings** — cell and neighborhood representations learned in latent space via JEPA.
- **Pretrained and ready to use** — download a model from the Hugging Face Hub and embed your own `AnnData` in a few lines.
- **Self-contained model bundles** — each release ships the checkpoint, tokenizer, and gene-reference files needed to reproduce its training-time harmonization.
- **Downstream analyses** — niche/cell-type clustering, gene-pair spatial scoring, EMD-based spatial structure, and perturbation.

## Installation

TERRA is published on PyPI as `terra-st` (the import name is `terra`) and
**requires an NVIDIA GPU**. Install PyTorch first (so it matches your GPU), then
TERRA — we recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

**1. Install PyTorch for your hardware.** Run `nvidia-smi`, read the "CUDA
Version" in the top-right, and install the matching CUDA build (see the
[PyTorch install guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)), e.g.:

```shell
uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

**2. Install TERRA.**

```shell
uv pip install terra-st
```

Plain `pip install terra-st` works too. For a development install from a clone
of this repository (after step 1): `uv pip install -e ".[dev,test,doc]"`.

Verify the install (PyTorch sees your GPU, and TERRA imports):

```shell
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__, torch.version.cuda, torch.cuda.is_available())"
python -c "import terra; print(terra.__version__)"
```

The last value from the first command should be `True` — TERRA requires a GPU.
If it prints `False`, PyTorch can't see your GPU (usually a CUDA build that
doesn't match your driver — revisit step 1).

## Quickstart

Download a pretrained model and embed your own spatial `AnnData` with the
end-to-end pipeline. Each downloaded bundle contains the gene-reference files
needed for harmonization, so no external paths are required:

```python
import anndata as ad
from terra import download_pretrained, harmonize_tokenize_embed_pipeline

adata = ad.read_h5ad("my_spatial_data.h5ad")   # raw counts in adata.X

model_dir = download_pretrained("Lotfollahi-lab/TERRA-96M")

adata = harmonize_tokenize_embed_pipeline(
    adata=adata,
    sample_key="sample",            # column in adata.obs identifying samples
    batch_key="batch",              # column to store the batch identifier
    model_folder_path=model_dir,
    cache_directory_path="./terra_cache",
)

# Cell- and neighborhood-level embeddings are now in adata.obsm.
```

See the [documentation](https://terra-st.readthedocs.io) for the step-by-step
pipeline, downstream analyses (niche identification, gene-pair scoring,
perturbation), and the full [tutorial](https://terra-st.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html).
