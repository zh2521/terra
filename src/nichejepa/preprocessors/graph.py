    Compute neighbor graph and optionally aggregate cell features across
    neighbors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata:
        AnnData object with spatial coordinates available in
        `adata.obsm['spatial']`.
    n_neighs:
        If specified, use `n_neighs` to compute the neighborhood graph.
        If 'radius' or 'delaunay' are also specified, an intersection
        neighborhood graph will be computed.
    radius:
        If specified, use `radius` to compute the neighborhood graph. If
        'n_neighs' or 'delaunay' are also specified, an intersection
        neighborhood graph will be computed.
    delaunay:
        If 'True', compute the neighborhood graph by delaunay
        triangulation. If 'n_neighs' or 'radius' are also specified, an
        intersection neighborhood graph will be computed.
    include_self_loop:
        If 'True', include cell itself in neighborhood graph.
    compute_neighbor_counts:
        If 'True', aggregate counts across neighborhood and store in
        `adata.layers['X_neighborhood']`.

    Returns
    ----------
    adata:
        AnnData object with aggregated counts available in
        `adata.layers['X_neighborhood']`.
