    Compute neighbor graph and optionally aggregate cell features across

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata:
        AnnData object with spatial coordinates available in
        `adata.obsm['spatial']`.
    n_neighs:
        If specified, use `n_neighs` to compute the neighborhood graph.
        If 'radius' or 'delaunay' are also specified, an intersection
        neighborhood graph will be computed.
    radius:
        If specified, use `radius` to compute the neighborhood graph. If
        'n_neighs' or 'delaunay' are also specified, an intersection
        neighborhood graph will be computed.
    delaunay:
        If 'True', compute the neighborhood graph by delaunay
        triangulation. If 'n_neighs' or 'radius' are also specified, an
        intersection neighborhood graph will be computed.
    include_self_loop:
        If 'True', include cell itself in neighborhood graph.
    batch_key:
        Key in adata.obs where the batch is stored in case the AnnData
        contains multiple batches. This is important to specify if there
        are multiple batches in the AnnData to perform separate neighbor
        graph computation and then concatenate.
    compute_neighbor_counts:
        If 'True', aggregate counts across neighborhood and store in
        `adata.layers['X_neighborhood']`.

        AnnData object with aggregated counts available in
