    Normalize gene expression counts per gene (within the batch) and

    Implements normalization as described in "Lause, J., Berens, P. & 
    Kobak, D. Analytic Pearson residuals for normalization of
    single-cell RNA-seq UMI data. Genome Biol. 22, 258 (2021)".
    Residuals are based on a negative binomial offset model with
    overdispersion shared across genes. Residuals are clipped to
    'sqrt(n_obs)'. Negative residuals for a cell and gene indicate that
    fewer counts are observed than expected, compared to the gene’s
    average expression and cell read depth. Positive residuals indicate
    more counts than expected. By default, overdispersion `theta=100` is
    used.

    The implementation is based on
    https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/4642cf8e2e51b257371792cb4fcb9611c0a81123/scanpy/experimental/pp/_normalization.py#L36.

    """
    Normalize gene expression counts per cell using PFlog1pPF
    (proportional fitting -> log1p -> proportional fitting).

    Implements the depth-normalization transform of "Booeshaghi, A. S.,
    Hallgrímsdóttir, I. B., Gálvez-Merchán, Á. & Pachter, L. Depth
    normalization for single-cell genomics count data. bioRxiv
    2022.05.06.490859". The authors show this is the only feature-
    relabeling-equivariant transform that jointly satisfies variance
    stabilization, depth normalization, and monotonicity, and that it
    is equivalent to a shifted centered-log-ratio transform.

    Three steps, all monotonic within a cell (so within-cell gene
    rankings are preserved) and all sparsity-preserving:
      1. PF: scale each cell's counts to a common depth (the mean total
         count across cells, or ``target_size`` if given). This is the
         first proportional fitting -- the depth-equalization step that
         ``log1pPF`` also has.
      2. log1p: ``log(u + pseudocount)`` applied to nonzero entries
         (``log1p(0) = 0`` keeps zeros zero).
      3. PF again: scale each cell's log-values to a common total (the
         mean of the per-cell log-sums). This second proportional
         fitting removes the residual depth structure that the
         logarithm reintroduces -- the key addition over ``log1pPF``.

    Because every step is a per-cell scalar rescale or a monotone
    elementwise map, the within-cell gene ordering is identical to the
    raw counts, so this is safe to use as either a ``rank`` or
    ``count`` count-norm method. It does its OWN depth normalization
    (steps 1 and 3), so it must NOT be combined with a separate
    cell-/gene-level norm method (that would double-normalize depth) --
    same constraint as ``analytic_pearson_residuals``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x:
        A sparse matrix where each row represents an observation and
        each column represents a feature, containing raw counts as
        features (i.e. not scaled or normalized).
    target_size:
        Common depth for the FIRST proportional fitting. ``None``
        (default) uses the mean total count across the cells in ``x``
        (per-call), matching the paper's PF convention; pass e.g.
        ``1e4`` for a CP10k-style fixed size factor, or the corpus-wide
        mean depth (``pf_depth_target`` from
        ``compute_cohort_norm_factors.py``) to freeze the first-PF scale
        across files / between train and inference. NB: because step 2
        is ``log1p`` (not ``log``), this target is NOT geometry-neutral
        -- it sets where counts sit relative to the pseudocount.
    logsum_target:
        Common total for the SECOND proportional fitting. ``None``
        (default) uses the mean per-cell log-sum across the cells in
        ``x`` (per-call); pass the corpus-wide value
        (``pf_logsum_target`` from ``compute_cohort_norm_factors.py``)
        to freeze the second-PF scale. This target is a pure global
        linear rescale of the output (does not change within-cell
        geometry).
    pseudocount:
        Pseudocount ``c`` added inside the log, i.e. ``log(u + c)``.
        Defaults to ``1.0`` (``log1p``), matching the paper's ``c = 1``.
