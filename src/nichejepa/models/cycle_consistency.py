"""
Batch-swap cycle-consistency loss for batch-invariant encoder
representations.

The idea (FADVI-style, Chen et al. 2024): if the encoder has truly
learned batch-invariant features, then swapping a cell's batch label
to a random other batch should leave the encoded representation
roughly unchanged. We enforce this by re-encoding the same cells
with random batch labels and minimizing the MSE between the original
and re-encoded outputs.

This is a strictly auxiliary loss applied after the main encoder
forward; it does NOT replace the JEPA objective. The double-forward
cost is gated by ``swap_fraction``: with probability ``swap_fraction``
per step, the swapped forward pass runs and contributes to the loss.
Otherwise the step is identical to a normal training step.

Implementation notes
--------------------
- The batch label lives in ``batch['values'][:, 0]`` by the
  tokenizer convention. Swapping it changes both:
  (a) the spv_batch special-value embedding at position 0, and
  (b) the AdaLN conditioning (if AdaLN is enabled), since AdaLN
  reads its cond from the same slot.
  Both are desired -- we want to test "what would the encoder
  output if you told it this cell was from a different batch."
- We swap *uniformly at random* over ``[0, n_batches)`` so the swap
  is symmetric and unbiased. Cells whose original label happens to
  equal the swap target are left as-is for that step (no MSE
  contribution, since the forward would be identical).

    is True iff at least one of the cell's labels actually
    changed -- the cycle-consistency loss then only averages over
    those cells where the swap was non-trivial.

    Args
    ----
    batch:
        Original batch dict. Not mutated.
    n_classes_per_key:
        Per-key upper bound (exclusive) on swapped labels.
        Scalar for single-key, list for multi-key.
    keys:
        Per-key metadata field name. ``None`` (or scalar None)
        triggers the legacy path: swap ``values[:, 0]``.
    offsets:
        Per-key offset applied when reading + writing the label,
        so the stored encoding round-trips unchanged.
    generator:
        Optional torch.Generator for reproducibility.

    Returns
    -------
    swapped_batch:
        Shallow copy of ``batch`` with the relevant tensors cloned
        and the per-key slots replaced.
    changed_mask:
        Bool tensor ``(B,)`` -- True for cells where *any* of the
        swapped keys differs from the original.
