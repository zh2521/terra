Input Data
----------
Required format:
    Raw counts spatial transcriptomics (ST) data with all genes (no feature selection) as '.h5ad' (anndata) files.
    Spatial coordinates are stored in adata.obsm["spatial"].
Required gene attributes:
    Ensembl ID for each gene ('ensembl_id').
Optional cell attributes:
    Binary indicator of whether cell should be used for tokenization based on user-defined filtering criteria
    ('filter_pass').
    Any other cell metadata can be passed on to the tokenized dataset as a custom attribute dictionary.

Usage
----------
.. code-block :: python
    >>> from nichejepa import STRankTokenizer
    >>> tk = STRankTokenizer(custom_attr_name_dict={"cell_type": "cell_types"}, nproc=4)
    >>> tk.tokenize_data("input_directory", "output_directory", "output_file_prefix")

Description
----------
Input data is a directory with '.h5ad' files containing raw counts from ST data, including all genes detected without
feature selection. The input file type is specified by the argument 'file_format' in the tokenize_data function. Genes
should be labeled with Ensembl IDs (adata.var['ensembl_id']), which provide a unique identifer for conversion to tokens.
Gene names can be converted to Ensembl IDs via the helper function nichejepa.utils.genes.get_ensembl_ids(). No cell
metadata is required, but custom cell attributes may be passed onto the tokenized dataset by providing a dictionary of
custom attributes, which is formatted as {original_attr_name: desired_dataset_attr_name}. For example, if the original
'.h5ad' file has cell attributes in adata.obs["cell_type"] and one would like to retain these attributes as labels in
the tokenized dataset with the new names "cell_types", the following custom attribute dictionary should be provided:
{"cell_type": "cell_types"}. Additionally, if the original '.h5ad' file contains a cell attribute called
adata.obs["filter_pass"], this will be used as a binary indicator of whether to include these cells in the tokenization.
All cells with "1" in this attribute will be tokenized, whereas the others will be excluded. One may use this column to
indicate QC filtering or other criteria for selection for inclusion in the final tokenized dataset. If one's data is in
other formats besides '.h5ad', one can use the relevant tools (such as Anndata tools) to convert the file to '.h5ad'
format prior to initializing the STRankTokenizer.

            residuals for normalization of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data. Genome Biol. 22, 258 (2021). The residuals are
            based on a negative binomial offset model with overdispersion 'theta' shared across genes. Residuals are
            clipped to 'sqrt(n_obs)' and overdispersion 'theta=100' is used. Negative residuals for a cell and gene
            indicate that less counts are observed than expected compared to the gene’s average expression and cellular
            sequencing depth. Positive residuals indicate more counts than expected. The implementation is based on
            https://github.com/scverse/scanpy/blob/4642cf8e2e51b257371792cb4fcb9611c0a81123/scanpy/experimental/pp/_normalization.py#L36
