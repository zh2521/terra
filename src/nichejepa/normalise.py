def analytic_pearson_residuals(x: scipy.sparse.csr_matrix, theta=100) -> scipy.sparse.csr_matrix:
    """
    Normalise using analytic pearson residuals

    Implements normalisation as described in "Lause, J., Berens, P. & Kobak, D. Analytic Pearson
    residuals for normalisation of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data. Genome Biol. 22, 258 (2021)". Residuals are
    based on a negative binomial offset model with overdispersion shared across genes. Residuals are
    clipped to 'sqrt(n_obs)'. Negative residuals for a cell and gene indicate that fewer counts are observed than
    expected, compared to the gene’s average expression and read depth. Positive residuals indicate more
    counts than expected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : scipy.sparse.csr_matrix
        A sparse matrix where each row represents an observation and each column represents a feature
    theta : float
        The overdispersion parameter
