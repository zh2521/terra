# TERRA

**TERRA** is a JEPA-based foundation model for spatial transcriptomics, developed by the
[Lotfollahi Lab](https://github.com/Lotfollahi-lab). It learns embeddings of cells in
their spatial context by predicting masked cell and neighborhood representations in
latent space, and transfers to downstream tasks such as niche identification,
batch-integrated atlasing, spatial gene-pair scoring, and in-silico perturbation.
