# User Guide

## Overview

TERRA is a foundation model for spatial transcriptomics based on a
**Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)**. Each cell is tokenized
together with its spatial neighbors into a sequence of gene tokens; parts of the
sequence are masked, and the model is trained to predict the *latent*
representations of the masked cell and neighborhood tokens rather than raw
counts. This yields embeddings that summarize both a cell's own expression and
its surrounding tissue microenvironment.

TERRA is pretrained on **HST-Corpus-112M**, a corpus of more than 100 million
cells at single-cell resolution spanning human spatial-transcriptomics datasets.
The pretrained embeddings
transfer to a range of downstream tasks without task-specific retraining.

## The inference pipeline

The user-facing API is exposed at the top level of `terra` (its implementation
lives in `terra.inference`). The typical workflow has three stages, exposed both
as a single convenience function and as individual steps:

1. **Harmonize** — map gene names to Ensembl IDs and apply quality control so the
   input matches the gene vocabulary the model was trained on
   (`harmonize_adata`).
2. **Tokenize** — build the per-cell neighborhood token sequences against a
   trained model's tokenizer (`tokenize_adata`).
3. **Embed** — run the model to retrieve cell- and neighborhood-level embeddings
   (`embed_dataset`).

The convenience wrapper `harmonize_tokenize_embed_pipeline` runs all three:

```python
from terra import download_pretrained, harmonize_tokenize_embed_pipeline

model_dir = download_pretrained("Lotfollahi-lab/TERRA-96M")

adata = harmonize_tokenize_embed_pipeline(
    adata=adata,                       # raw counts in adata.X
    sample_key="sample",
    batch_key="batch",
    model_folder_path=model_dir,
    cache_directory_path="./terra_cache",
)
```

The resulting cell- and neighborhood-level embeddings are stored in
`adata.obsm`. See the {doc}`tutorials` for the step-by-step version and downstream
analyses, and the {doc}`api` for the full reference.

:::{note}
TERRA reports progress through the standard `logging` module rather than
printing to stdout. To see progress messages (for example in a notebook), enable
logging once:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level="INFO")
```

The command-line entry points (`terra-hub`, `terra.training`, `terra.inference`)
configure this for you automatically.

## Pretrained models

Pretrained TERRA models are distributed on the
[Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/Lotfollahi-lab). Each model is a
self-contained *bundle* — the checkpoint, model config, token dictionary, and the
gene-reference files needed to reproduce the model's training-time harmonization
(`ensembl_dictionary.pkl`, `gene_count_dictionary.pkl`).

| Model | Training data |
| --- | --- |
| `TERRA-96M` | A 96M-cell subset of HST-Corpus-112M; the remaining cells are held out for benchmarking and downstream analyses. |
| `TERRA-112M` | The full HST-Corpus-112M. |

Download a bundle with `download_pretrained`; the returned folder is what you pass
as `model_folder_path`:

```python
from terra import download_pretrained

model_dir = download_pretrained("Lotfollahi-lab/TERRA-96M")          # latest
model_dir = download_pretrained("Lotfollahi-lab/TERRA-96M", revision="v1.0")  # pinned
```

Because the gene-reference files are part of the bundle, harmonization at
inference time reproduces the tokenization the model was trained with — no
external file paths are required.
